<P>This article is about a form of physical exercise focusing on bodyweight movements. For the Australian competitive performing art, see
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calisthenics_(Australia)" target="_self"> Calisthenics (Australia).</a> </P>
<p><b>Calisthenics</b> (American English) or <b>callisthenics</b> (British English) 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English" target="_self">(/ˌkælɪsˈθɛnɪks/)</a> is a form of 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_training" target="_top">strength training</a> that utilizes an individual's body weight as resistance to perform multi-joint, compound movements with little or no equipment.</p>
    <CEnter><img src="download.jpeg" alt="PLANCHE" width="800" height="800"></CEnter>
    <H2><U>Origin and etymology:-</U></H2>
    <P>The 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_English_Dictionary" target="_self">Oxford English Dictionary</a> describes callisthenics as "gymnastic exercises to achieve fitness and grace of movement".The word calisthenics comes from the ancient Greek words κάλλος (kállos), which means "beauty", and σθένος (sthenos), meaning "strength". It is the art of using one's 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodyweight_exercise" target="_self">body weight as resistance</a>a to develop muscles.</P>

        <p>The practice was recorded as being used in 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece" target="_blank"> ancient Greece,</a> including by the armies of Alexander the Great and the Spartans at the 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Thermopylae" target="_self">Battle of Thermopylae.</a></P>
          <p>Calisthenics was also recorded to have been used in 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_China#Ancient_China" target="_self">ancient China</a>. Along with dietary practices, Han dynasty physicians prescribed calisthenics as one of the methods for maintaining one's health.</p>
<h2>Common exercises</h2>
<p>The more commonly performed calisthenic exercises include:</p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push-up" target="_self" id="Push-ups">Push-upsa:</a>
<center><img src="weighted-push-up-muscles-1024x374.png" alt="Push-up"></center>
<p>Performed face down on the floor, palms against the floor under the shoulders, toes curled upwards against the floor. The arms are used to lift the body while maintaining a straight line from head to heel. The arms go from fully extended in the high position to nearly fully flexed in the low position while avoiding resting on the floor.This exercise trains the chest, shoulders, and triceps. An easier version of this exercise consists of placing the hands on a wall and then bending and straightening the arms.</p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sit-up">Sit-ups:</a>
<img src="butterfly-sit-up.gif" alt="sit ups">
<p>A person lies on their back with their legs bent. They bend at the waist and move their head and torso towards their legs. They then lower themselves back down to the start position. For people who find it difficult to get down onto the ground, a similar range of motion can be achieved by standing with the legs slightly bent, and then bowing slightly and straightening up again.</p>
<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crunch_(exercise)" target="_self"  id="Curl-ups">Curl-ups:</a></h2>
<img src="wall-crunch-muscles-1536x958.png" alt="crush">
<center><img src="wall-crunch.gif" alt="crush"></center>
<p>Curl-up is an abdominal exercise that enables both building and defining "six-pack" abs and tightening the belly.</p>
<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squat_(exercise)" id="Squats">Squats:</a></h2>
<img src="squat-hold-2-seconds.gif" alt="squat">
<p>Standing with the feet a shoulder-width apart, the subject squats down until their thighs are parallel with the floor; during this action, they move their arms forwards in front of them. They then return to a standing position whilst moving their arms back to their sides. Squats train the quadriceps, hamstrings, calves, gluteal muscles, and core. The height of the squat can be adjusted to be deeper or shallower depending on the fitness level of the individual (i.e. half or quarter squats rather than full squats). Since squats can be performed easily in most environments and with a limited amount of space, they are among the most versatile calisthenic exercises.</p>
<h2 id="guru">
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pull-up_(exercise)">Chin-ups and pull-ups:</a></h2>
<img src="chin-ups.gif" alt="chin-up">
<p><i>Chin-ups and pull-ups</i> are similar exercises but use opposite facing grips.
    For a chin-up, the palms of the hands are facing the person as they pull up their body using the chin-up bar. The chin-up involves the biceps muscles more than the pull-up but the lats are still the primary mover.</p>
    <p>For a pull-up, the bar is grasped using a shoulder-width grip. The subject lifts their body up, chin level with the bar, keeping their back straight throughout the exercise. The bar remains in front of the subject at all times. The subject then slowly returns to starting position in a slow, controlled manner. This primarily trains the lats, and secondary muscles working are upper back muscles, as well as the forearms and core muscles.</p>
<h2  id="chandra"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dip_(exercise)">Dips:</a></h2>
<center><img src="parallel-bar-tricep-dips.gif" alt="dipes"></center>
<p>Done between parallel bars or facing either direction of trapezoid bars found in some gyms. Feet are crossed, with either foot in front and the body is lowered until the elbows are in line with the shoulders. The subject then pushes up until the arms are fully extended, but without locking the elbows. Dips focus primarily on the chest, triceps, and deltoids, especially the anterior portion.</p>
<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biceps" id="Biceps">Biceps:</a></h2>
<img src="bicep-curl-muscles-1536x1081.png" alt="biceps">
<center><img src="lateral-bicep-curls.gif" alt="biceps"></center>
<p>To perform a repetition of the lateral bicep curl, the lifter begins by standing upright with a pair of dumbbells gripped at either side, palms facing outwards and elbows pressed flush against the trunk.
    Rather than adopting the conventional curl stance, the forearms and hands should be twisted outwards, the elbows almost pointing towards the midline of the body.</p>
